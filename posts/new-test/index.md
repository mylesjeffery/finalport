Ordr is a nightlife app designed to streamline the experience of a night out, providing less hassle and more fun. Users can pay bar covers or buy tickets for club events, and order drinks from their phone. No more queueing outside in the cold, trips to the ATM, or struggling to catch the bartender's attention in a packed bar.\
\
I designed an intuitive user experience that guides one through the necessary hurdles of a night out, giving the user more time for what's important– fun. I came up with a brand identity & strategy that simultaneously evokes a sense of mystery, intrigue, and adventure.

## User Experience

To research this project, I went through the experience of going out, drew upon my past experiences, and interviewed friends to see what the primary features of the app should offer.

I found that there were three areas of the experience that had opportunities to be streamlined: first, finding the right venue to go to. In a big city, there are so many options for a night out that it can be overwhelming at first, and there isn't a specific resource for bars & clubs. Second, once the user has actually found a venue they want to go to, actually getting into the bar or club can be a struggle. If there is a line outside, or there is a cover, the user should be able to find that information out before getting to the venue. And third, actually ordering drinks once inside. In many bars and clubs, the music can be very loud making communication with the bartender difficult. Opening and closing tabs is an unnecessary hassle that inconveniences the user and bartender.

After gathering my research, I wrote down the core functionalities the app needed to have.

1. Nearby bars browsing with filters for type of venue, cover/no cover, busy-ness, and rating.
2. Apple-pay cover system, user pays cover and receives QR Code in app to scan with bouncer.
3. Menu and drink ordering via Apple-pay.
4. Ordr number system where user receives wait time info and notifies user when it's time to pick up.
5. Large number display for signaling to bartender where user is located in bar.

I developed a prototype of the app in Figma, to demonstrate the user experience and convey how the app would look and feel. I aimed to guide the user through the experience, never showing more information than was necessary.\

## Branding

The brand was developed in conjunction with the app. As I was thinking about how the app should flow and feel, I was thinking about how the brand should reflect the themes and concepts of nightlife, and the fluidity and utility the app provides. The core turquoise color is used to identify the brand as well as draw attention to certain objects in the app, like favorite drinks or bars the user frequents.

I tested the app on my friends, the target audience of young adults 21-30 years old. They provided me with useful information about how to better structure information and make certain features of the app clearer.\
\
I also asked them questions about the brand, like how it made them feel, what words were used to express what they see from the logo and brand content.

Below is a sticker that would be featured in participating venues' windows, so the user can scan the QR Code and automatically open the app to their page.
