It's time to bring parking into the 21st century. Parcark is an app designed to make the simple yet often frustrating experience of finding and paying for parking more efficient and rewarding.\
\
With Parcark, users can view the number of open parking spots in a location, view parking prices, navigate to the nearest available spot, and pay, with local business offers for parking validation. Parcark alleviates the worry of running out of time on your parking meter, as users can add more time to the meter from the app. If the user decides to leave the spot before their time runs out, they are able to receive parking credit for the time they didn't use.\
\
My task was to design an integrated brand identity and user experience, that was simple to use and evoked a strong personality.

For Parcark's branding, I aimed to design a playful, friendly, and simple identity, with clear connotations of driving. The animated logo features the word "car" parking itself in the word Parcark, illustrating the function of the app.\
\
The name "Parcark" is a slang work used by Brits to call a car-park (their term for a parking lot). The main logo contains an abstracted capital "P" with an arrow pointing to the right implying the pulling over to park, similar to a road sign. The bold yellow and black colors also symbolize the road. For the "Parcark" type, I chose a semi-bold Poppins typeface, as its geometric sans-serif simplicity has a friendly familiarity.
