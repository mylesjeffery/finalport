It's time to bring parking into the 21st century. Parcark is an app designed to make the simple yet often frustrating experience of finding and paying for parking more efficient and rewarding.\
\
With Parcark, users can view the number of open parking spots in a location, view parking prices, navigate to the nearest available spot, and pay, with local business offers for parking validation. Parcark alleviates the worry of running out of time on your parking meter, as users can add more time to the meter from the app. If the user decides to leave the spot before their time runs out, they are able to receive parking credit for the time they didn't use.\
\
My task was to design an integrated brand identity and user experience, that was simple to use and evoked a strong personality.

## User Experience

In this video demo, the user searches for the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, to see what the parking options are around the museum. The app shows an estimate of how many spots are available and what the price range is per hour for that area. It shows a green circle overlay, indicating that there are plenty of spots available. Once the user is in the area, or wherever they are at any time, they can press the "Park Me" button, to direct them to the nearest parking spot. Once the user has parked, they can pay by scanning a QR Code on the parking meter, or enter a code displayed. They set how much time they would like to put on the meter, and then pay via the phone's payment system (Apple Pay or Google Pay). Once paid, the user is shown nearby business validations, that will credit them parking credit to use in the future at any parking spot in Parcark's system. When the user opens the app next, they are shown by default a timer with how much time they have left on their meter, with options to add more time or validate. When the timer runs down to five minutes, the user is alerted and asked to either add more time or return to their car and leave the parking spot. When the user leaves the spot, however much time was left on the meter will be credited to their account for future use.

This experience was created from first hand experience, parking in big cities can be extremely difficult, and you can be driving around for an hour trying to find a spot some days. This UX was designed to guide the user through the experience, addressing pain points that would normally frustrate the user without the app. 

## Branding

For Parcark's branding, I aimed to design a playful, friendly, and simple identity, with clear connotations of driving. The animated logo features the word "car" parking itself in the word Parcark, playfully illustrating the function of the app. \
\
The name "Parcark" is a slang work used by Brits to call a car-park (their term for a parking lot). The main logo contains an abstracted capital "P" with an arrow pointing to the right implying the pulling over to park, similar to a road sign. The bold yellow and black colors also symbolize the road. For the "Parcark" type, I chose a semi-bold Poppins typeface, as its geometric sans-serif simplicity has a friendly familiarity.
