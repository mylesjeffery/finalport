description: Practice project for my favorite art museum, the de Young in San
  Francisco. I aimed to create an identity that encapsulated the architecture,
  exhibits, and inclusivity of the museum.

The de Young Museum in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park is my favorite art museum. Its iconic architecture, engaging exhibits, and extensive art collections from around the world set it apart.\
\
The de Young brand, however, could use a refresh. It's dull and forgettable, and doesn't do the museum justice. I set out to design a new brand identity, one that is as singular & impactful as the museum and adaptable to the diverse range of art it contains.\
\
The de Young is one of two museums organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, (FAMSF) the other being the Legion of Honor Museum in Land's End. Although the focus of this project was on the de Young, I also designed a cohesive brand system for FAMSF and its museums.\
\
I identified three themes to work around: diversity, materiality, and universality.
