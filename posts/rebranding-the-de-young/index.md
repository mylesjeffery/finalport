description: Practice project for my favorite art museum, the de Young in San
  Francisco. I aimed to create an identity that encapsulated the architecture,
  exhibits, and inclusivity of the museum.

The de Young Museum in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park is my favorite art museum. Its iconic architecture, engaging exhibits, and extensive art collections from around the world set it apart.\
\
The de Young brand, however, could use a refresh. It's dull and forgettable, and doesn't do the museum justice. I set out to design a new brand identity, one that is as singular & impactful as the museum and adaptable to the diverse range of art it contains.\
\
I identified three themes to work around: diversity, materiality, and universality.

The inspiration for the de Young logo came from the materiality of the museum. I referenced the architecture of the de Young's iconic Hamon Observation Tower(pictured below), with the angled "Y", as the tower twists and creates a Y shape.\
\
Further referencing the structure of the building, I placed the text on off-center orange blocks, evoking an architectural feeling. I chose orange as the default color of the blocks, as it references the copper exterior of the museum, and has a visual impact. The staggered step like arrangement of the words "de Young" over "Museum" represent the multi-leveled architecture and also mimic the overhang that exists on the side of the museum over the outdoor cafe seating area. \
\
Helvetica Neue Bold was chosen as the base typeface, as it has a universality & adaptability to many different contexts. The goal was to let the brand be a platform for the art inside, so I chose arguably the most familiar typeface in existence, while adding the twist of the capital "Y" to give it a unique personality.

The de Young is one of two museums organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, (FAMSF) the other being the Legion of Honor Museum in Land's End. Although the focus of this project was on the de Young, I also designed a cohesive brand system for FAMSF and its museums. The FAMSF logo reflects the building block-like nature of the de Young logo, but interacts differently. See below, the blocks of the FAMSF appear to playfully fall into place around the de Young, Legion of Honor, and Brand Guidelines blocks.

Above is an example of how the de Young logo form can act as a platform for art. This billboard features the basic shape of the main de Young logo cut out to reveal the art representing the exhibit it is advertising. Below, the logo is tessellated for a rainbow gay pride effect on a tote bag. The potential adaptability for the logo is endless.
